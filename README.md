# tic_tac_toe

This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game played in a browser. This is an exercise is use of Factory Functions and Modules. There is very little to no UI in this project, as this was focused on Factory Functions and modular JS.

Takeaways:
The use of modules really helps to keep code clean while developing (with the help of an IDE).
In addition, I can protect things I don't want exposed to the public.

Notes:
This project may be revisited to beautify and implement the leftover 10% functionality I decided to forgo in interest of time.
